When you open the PDF along the top of the viewing window you have to agree to trust the document ( don’t worry I just saved it out from our modeling software) than anywhere in the white area you just click and it’ll load the model up, from there you can just drag the model around using the left mouse button and zoom with the mouse wheel. Right clicking gives you a section for tools from which you can measure parts of the model.
